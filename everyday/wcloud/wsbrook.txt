We present a systematic analysis of CO adsorption on Pt nanoclusters in the 0.2−1.5 nm size range with the aim of unraveling size-dependent trends and developing predictive models for site-specific adsorption behavior. Using an empirical- potential-based genetic algorithm and density functional theory (DFT) modeling, we show that there exists a size window (40−70 atoms) over which Pt nanoclusters bind CO weakly, the binding energies being comparable to those on (111) or (100) facets. The size-dependent adsorption energy trends are, however, distinctly nonmonotonic and are not readily captured using traditional descriptors such as d-band energies or (generalized) coordination numbers of the Pt binding sites. Instead, by applying machine-learning algorithms, we show that multiple descriptors, broadly categorized as structural and electronic descriptors, are essential for qualitatively capturing the CO adsorption trends. Nevertheless, attaining quantitative accuracy requires further refinement, and we propose the use of an additional descriptors the fully frozen adsorption energy that is a computationally inexpensive probe of CO−Pt bond formation. With these three categories of descriptors, we achieve an absolute mean error in CO adsorption energy prediction of 0.12 eV, which is similar to the underlying error of DFT adsorption calculations. Our approach allows for building quantitatively predictive models of site-specific adsorbate binding on realistic, low-symmetry nanostructures, which is an important step in modeling reaction networks as well as for rational catalyst design in general.

The d-band center for metals has been widely used in order to understand activity trends in metal-surface- catalyzed reactions in terms of the linear Brønsted–Evans–Polanyi relation and Hammer–Nørskov d-band model. In this paper, the d-band centers for eleven metals (Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Ir, Pt, Au) and their pairwise bimetals for two different structures (1% metal doped- or overlayer-covered metal surfaces) are statistically predicted using machine learning methods from readily available values as descriptors for the target metals (such as the density and the enthalpy of fusion of each metal). The predictive accuracy of four regression methods with different numbers of descriptors and different test-set/training-set ratios are quantitatively evaluated using statistical cross validations. It is shown that the d-band centers are reasonably well predicted by the gradient boosting regression (GBR) method with only six descriptors, even when we predict 75% of the data from only 25% given for training (average root mean square error (RMSE) < 0.5 eV). This demonstrates a potential use of machine learning methods for predicting the activity trends of metal surfaces with a negligible CPU time compared to first-principles methods.
